# Jme-VFX

VFX Library for JMonkeyEngine. This is a work in progress: APIs may change.

## Dependencies
This library requires:
* JMonkeyEngine 3.6
* Lemur 1.16
* Heart
* Boost (my personal utilities)

Demos additionally require:
* SkyControl

All, except Boost, are common libraries for JMonkeyEngine.
